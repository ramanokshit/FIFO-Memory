# 8-bit Dual-Clock FIFO Memory  
This repository contains the Verilog implementation of an 8-bit dual-clock FIFO memory, designed for efficient data transfer between asynchronous clock domains. A Queue but acts as a circular buffer that comes with read/write control, empty/full status flags and a count.
